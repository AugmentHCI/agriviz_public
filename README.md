This repository contains six visual-assisted decision support systems (DSS) developed for six agricultural use cases, namely: [Correlation Analysis of Multivariate Data](https://github.com/AugmentHCI/agriviz_public/tree/main/gacovi), [Analysis of Plant Growth](https://github.com/AugmentHCI/agriviz_public/tree/main/Leaf-Counting), [Exploratory Analysis of Heterogeneous Data](https://github.com/AugmentHCI/agriviz_public/tree/main/VinetoWine), [Analysis of Water Stress and Irrigation Requirements](https://github.com/AugmentHCI/agriviz_public/tree/main/Irrigation), [Analysis of Biological Efficacy in By-Products](https://github.com/AugmentHCI/agriviz_public/tree/main/biological-efficacy), and [Uncertainty-Aware Price Prediction](https://github.com/AugmentHCI/agriviz_public/tree/main/product-prices). Please go to the individual folders for instructions on how to deploy the systems.
